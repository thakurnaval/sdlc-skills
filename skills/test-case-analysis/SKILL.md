# Test Case Analysis

Execute a TMS test case against the live app, observe what actually
happens, and emit an **Automation-Friendly Spec (AFS)** a downstream
engineer can implement without re-exploring.

**Core philosophy:** a written test case is a hypothesis. The app is
the only source of truth. This skill never trusts the case as
authored — it runs it step by step, captures stable selectors,
flags defects, and only then produces a spec.

## Absolute boundaries

- **No automation code.** No `.spec.ts`, no `test_*.py`, no step
  definitions. The output is a markdown AFS file. Automation is
  implemented by a downstream engineer (see
  [`test-automation-workflow`](../test-automation-workflow/) and the
  `test-automation-engineer` role).
- **No automating un-automatable cases.** Physical device, visual
  judgment that can't be asserted, flows that genuinely can't be
  scripted — mark the AFS `un-automatable` and stop.
- **No skipping exploration.** Even if the TMS case looks complete,
  execute it. The case describes intent; only execution reveals truth.

## The six-phase loop (one case at a time)

```
1. Fetch the case         → TMS adapter (pluggable; see test-automation.yaml)
2. Read app context       → .agents/architecture.md + previous AFS files
3. Execute                → playwright-testing or browser-verify, step-by-step
4. Capture selectors      → stable, accessible, fallback-ready
5. Classify findings      → ready / blocked / defect-found / un-automatable
6. Emit AFS               → test-specs/<feature>/l<pri>_<slug>_<tms-id>.md
```

### 1. Fetch the case

Use the adapter declared in `.agents/test-automation.yaml`. If
`transport: mcp` and the MCP server is online, prefer MCP tool calls
(`mcp__<server>__<tool>` / `<server>/<tool>` depending on host) —
no secrets travel through the agent's context. Otherwise use HTTP
with the configured `auth_env`. If no adapter is configured, read
the markdown case from `test-specs/`. If the TMS is unreachable,
open the case in the browser and copy it by hand — do not block on a
flaky TMS.

Extract: name, priority, preconditions, steps, expected, cleanup,
linked story, attachments.

### 2. Read app context

- `.agents/architecture.md` — know the surfaces you'll touch
- Previous AFS files in `test-specs/<feature>/` — match their shape
- Existing page objects — selector notes should align with what exists

### 3. Execute

Three browser tools sit at different layers; pick by what's wired and
what challenge you're solving. Full triage:
[`../test-automation-workflow/references/browser-tools.md`](../test-automation-workflow/references/browser-tools.md).
In short:

- **Default** — [`playwright-testing`](../playwright-testing/)
  (Playwright MCP). Prefer `browser_snapshot` for accessible-name
  discovery — it yields both the ref you need to click and the
  role-name pair you'll assert on.
- **MCP server not wired** — [`playwright-cli`](../playwright-cli/)
  drives the same browser surface from the shell (`codegen`,
  `--trace`, multi-tab, storage, request mocking).
- **Visual / CDP / a11y** — [`browser-verify`](../browser-verify/)
  for computed styles, real CDP input events, storage/cookies, or axe
  audits.

Soft guidance, not a hard rule: switching tools mid-case is fine when
the first one isn't producing useful evidence — note which tool
produced which observation in the AFS so the next reader can follow.

For each step:

1. Perform the real action. Never synthesize a click via
   `page.evaluate` — the app may react differently.
2. Screenshot. Always.
3. Check console messages. **Even when the UI looks fine.** Silent
   JS errors are the worst bugs.
4. Check network. Note which requests fire and which payloads matter.
5. Observe actual vs expected. Record both if they differ.

### 4. Capture selectors

Priority order — document in the AFS for every interactive element:

1. `data-testid` / `data-test` — stable, intentional
2. ARIA role + accessible name — `getByRole('button', { name: 'Apply' })`
3. Accessible label — `getByLabel('Email')`
4. Text content — `getByText('Sign in')` (fragile to i18n)
5. CSS selector — last resort; prefer one anchored to a stable attribute

Always give a **fallback**. Apps change. A single selector per
element is a single point of failure.

### 5. Classify findings

Status per case (goes in the AFS metadata block):

- **ready-for-automation** — case executed end-to-end, selectors
  captured, no blockers
- **blocked** — analyst hit a wall (access, data, env); the AFS's
  "Blocked Steps" section lists what's needed to unblock
- **defect-found** — real product bug prevents completion. File it
  via [`bugfix-workflow`](../bugfix-workflow/) before emitting the
  AFS; reference the bug ID in the AFS
- **un-automatable** — keep as manual; do not emit an AFS; update
  the TMS note

When you find a defect during execution:

- Do not force-continue past it hoping it "probably works later".
- **Always file a tracking ticket.** Nothing slips through: every
  finding (clarification, question, blocker, full defect) gets
  tracked somewhere the team sees. How depends on profile.md.
- Determine **where** the ticket lands by reading
  `.agents/profile.md` § Project systems § Bug filing. Three
  destinations are supported (operator configured during scout
  seeding):
  - **`github-issue`** *(default)* — open a standalone issue in the
    repo's tracker. Use `bugfix-workflow` templates + the
    `issue-tracking` skill.
  - **`story-subtask`** — create a sub-task under the originating
    Jira/Azure story (the story the TMS case is linked to). Fetch
    the story ID via the TMS adapter's `get_test_case_links`, then
    create the sub-task via the issue-tracker's API / MCP.
  - **`separate-ticket`** — file in a dedicated QA/bugs project,
    not the main development tracker. Target is named in
    profile.md § Bug filing target.
- Determine **whether to bundle or split** by reading
  § Bundling policy and classifying the finding's severity:
  - **Classify the finding first**:
    - *Lightweight clarification / question* — expected behavior
      unclear, minor UI copy ambiguity, missing doc, "should this
      modal close on outside-click?"-type questions
    - *Real defect* — reproducible bug, functional breakage,
      incorrect data, blocker — anything where the product is
      provably wrong
  - **`strict-per-bug`** *(default)* — every finding (either class)
    gets its own ticket. Done.
  - **`bundle-per-case`** *(opt-in, requires umbrella-ticket
    convention already in place on the project)*:
    - If the finding is a *real defect* → its own ticket (same as
      strict-per-bug). Real defects never bundle.
    - If the finding is a *lightweight clarification* → check if
      there's already an open "umbrella" ticket for this TMS case.
      - If yes: add the finding as a comment on the existing ticket.
      - If no: file a new umbrella ticket (title e.g.
        "Clarifications for SCRUM-T101") and make this the first
        comment. Future lightweight findings on the same case
        attach here.

    The umbrella-lookup is the fragile step — getting it wrong
    duplicates tickets. Defer to `strict-per-bug` unless the
    operator's `profile.md § Bug filing style` explicitly selects
    `bundle-per-case` **and** the project already has:
    - A title convention for umbrella tickets (so the
      find-or-create search has something stable to match on).
    - A documented comment-anchor format that Sage can reference
      from the AFS (e.g. "comment-3" or a permalink fragment).
    Without both, `strict-per-bug` is the safe default; one more
    ticket is cheaper than a missed clarification.
- Open the ticket (or add the comment) with reproduction steps,
  severity, evidence (screenshot, console, network) — `bugfix-workflow`
  has the body template; adapt the destination + bundling per
  profile.md.
- If `.agents/profile.md` § Bug filing is `Unconfirmed`, stop and ask
  the operator before filing — don't pick a default silently.
- Note the finding in the AFS under "Known Defects Found" with the
  ticket ID, filing style, and a recommendation — soft-expect
  (isolated) or natural-fail (blocking). Under `bundle-per-case`,
  reference both the umbrella ticket ID and the comment anchor so
  Axel can find the specific note (e.g. "Known defect: JIRA
  SCRUM-BUG-42 comment-3 — soft-expect", or
  "Known defect: GH#234 — natural-fail").

### 6. Emit AFS

A single markdown file per case, per the structure in
[`references/spec-format.md`](references/spec-format.md). Path:

```
test-specs/<feature>/l<priority>_<slug>_<tms-id>.md
```

The AFS is the contract. If it's ambiguous, the downstream engineer
will come back asking — which means the execution pass wasn't
complete. Make it stand alone.

## Evidence paths (convention)

```
test-results/screenshots/<tms-id>-step-<n>-<action>.png
test-results/json/<tms-id>-<iso-timestamp>.json
```

Relative paths inside the AFS; the automation engineer re-uses the
same convention for CI artifacts.

## Batching cases

When handed multiple cases:

- Single case → run directly. No delegation.
- Multiple cases → delegate one sub-agent per case via the host's
  `Agent` / `runSubagent` / `task` tool. Each sub-agent gets its own
  browser context.
- After sub-agents finish, retrieve each one's final message via the
  host's `read_agent` tool (NOT a shell command), extract the AFS
  path, **verify the file exists on disk**, and recreate it yourself
  from the returned content if it didn't persist. See
  [`test-automation-workflow/references/commands.md`](../test-automation-workflow/references/commands.md)
  for host-specific recipes.

## Handoff

When the AFS is ready:

1. Commit the AFS on a feature branch — `test(spec): add AFS for <id>`
2. Push; open a small PR if the project reviews specs before
   automation starts, otherwise hand the path directly to the
   automation engineer (see `test-automation-workflow`)
3. If a defect was found, link the issue in the PR body
4. If the case is `blocked` or `un-automatable`, stop here and
   report up — do not pass a broken spec downstream

## Anti-patterns

- **Writing automation code.** Not this skill's scope. Stop.
- **Copying the case text into the AFS verbatim without executing.**
  The AFS needs *discovered* selectors, *observed* network calls,
  *confirmed* expected vs actual. A copy-paste AFS is lying.
- **Skipping the console check** because "the UI looks fine". Silent
  errors are the ones that ship.
- **Force-continuing past a defect** to complete the AFS. A defect
  invalidates downstream steps — you no longer know what "expected"
  means.
- **Inventing selectors.** If you didn't click it, it doesn't go in
  the selector table. Run the step.
- **`test.fail()`-style thinking.** If a step fails for a real
  product reason, that's a defect, not a caveat in the AFS.
